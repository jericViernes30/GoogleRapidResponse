__Rapid Response__ is a mobile application designed to provide swift access to emergency medical assistance. 

Our goal is to offer a user-friendly interface that enables quick requests for help in critical situations, especially for households with children under the age of 7. By simplifying the process to a single action—pressing a big red button — Rapid Response empowers users to seek urgent aid from their nearest local barangay with ease, eliminating the complexities of dialing emergency hotlines.
